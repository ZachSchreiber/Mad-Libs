Many people also go to NOUN to VERB or see the PLURAL ANIMAL. The people that live there love to VERB PLURAL-NOUN and are very proud of their big NOUN. They also like to VERB in the sun and swim in the NOUN. It was a really ADJECTIVE trip!"

The only other person who understands what's going on is a ADJECTIVE child. He and NOUN begin to uncover clues about the NOUN, and it continues to get more awkward and uncomfortable, but the child helps give him NOUN. The two work together to get to the bottom of the NOUN. Then, when it seems unsolvable, NOUN (played by M. Night Shyamalan) shows up to explain what's going on."
